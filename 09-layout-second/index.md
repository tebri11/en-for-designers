### Presentation
#### Inspiration
- I chose 3 basic colors - red, yellow, blue.
- My great inspiration was a climbing wall for children and the flag of Kutn치 Hora. 
- My main and great inspiration are children. I want the overall visualization to be playful and funny.

#### Logotype
- I created a new logotype GASK that will characterize the education center. My primary goal was to create a logotype that will create simple communication. The word ASK will accompany us throughout the communication. 
- I created 3 variants of logotypes that characterize certain programs.
