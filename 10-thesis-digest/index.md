### Main Text
The center was established to understand and bring contemporary art to the audience. As the organization's teaching center does not currently have a comprehensive visual and communication style, I will also work on creating a new communication strategy.
The bachelor thesis is divided into the theoretical and practical parts. First of all, I will describe and explain the theoretical background that is necessary for the practical part of the bachelor's thesis, I will also analyze the techniques and tools used.
In the practical part, I analyze the current state of the researched teaching center and describe my design of marketing and visual communication.
My main goal is to create visual communication and strategic solution for the GASK teaching center in Kutná Hora and at the same time to raise awareness of the existence of the Central Bohemian Region Gallery. At the same time, I want to raise the profile and raise the teaching center, to build positive public relations with this place so that the GASK organization becomes a new refuge and visit the place.

#### Logotype ASK
- I created a new logotype ASK that will characterize the education center. My primary goal was to create a logotype that will create simple communication. The word ASK and ANSWER will accompany us throughout the communication.

#### Education Center ASK
- The first concept is the design of outdoor advertising (Citylights and Billboards), which introduces the education center. Each piece of information brings with it an important message that informs about an interesting activity, or some interesting thing.

#### Programs
- It is also important to present the individual programs that the center offers. Posters are the main advertising medium.
- ASK - family ,,Shall we take daddy with us?"
- ASK - school ,,Do I have to use a ruler?"
- ASK - kids ,,Which color is the right one?"
