### Main Text
1. During my studies at the school in the field of graphic design and media communication, I gained a lot of experience. For this reason, I decided to accept the challenge in the field of visual and marketing communication and create a new working concept of visual communication for the education center. The center is operated by the organization Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region in Kutn√° Hora. The center was established to understand and bring contemporary art to the public as a natural way of life. My goal is to create visual communication and strategic solution for the education center GASK in Kutn√° Hora and at the same time to raise attendance of the Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region. At the same time, I want to raise the profile of the education center, to build a positive public attitude towards this place so that the GASK organization becomes a new refuge and visiting the place.
