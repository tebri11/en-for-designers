## ðŸŒ¸ Storytelling

Why do you love what you do?
- Sometimes design is an escape from reality for me. I love days with a creative mood, new ideas.

What do you believe in? Whatâ€™s your design philosophy?
- "Things should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Every brand identity, logo, and design we develop must have a story and meaning behind it and hopefully always be intelligently conceived. 

Who or what inspires you? Where does your inspiration come from?
- I have no role model. Sometimes I am inspired by artists, designers, illustrators on Instagram and Pinterest because you can see many original pictures, photos, creative and ideas. There are days when I have a new idea out of nowhere - at the forest, at home, with friends, in the gallery, on the trip, etc.

When was that aha moment?
- That aha moment was created when I was first approached in elementary school - you are an artist! I love everything about drawing. That was the point why I decided to absolve the first art course called Draw Planet.
