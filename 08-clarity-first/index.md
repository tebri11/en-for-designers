## Summary
- GA - Gallery, S - Central Bohemian (St≈ôedoƒçesk√Ω), K - Region (Kraj)
- During my studies at the school in the field of graphic design and media communication, I gained a lot of experience. For this reason, I decided to accept the challenge in the field of visual and marketing communication and create a new working concept of visual communication for the education center. 

- The center is operated by the organization Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region in Kutn√° Hora. The center was established to understand and bring contemporary art to the public as a natural way of life. As the organization's education center does not currently have a visual and communication style, I will also create a new communication strategy.

### What problems did the project solve?
- My goal is to create visual communication and strategic solution for the education center GASK in Kutn√° Hora and at the same time to raise attendance of the Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region. At the same time, I want to raise the profile of the education center, to build a positive public attitude towards this place so that the GASK organization becomes a new refuge and visiting the place.
- This gallery offers the most programs, workshops, and events for children and families. So I decided to focus on the lower age category, thanks to their offer for children and youth.
- The project is still in process. I want to run higher activity on social networks, especially Instagram which has the highest expansion today.

### What actions did you take to this project?
- I was at the GASK center a few years ago, thanks to which I know the center better. So I know this center is a great place for kids.
- For a few months, I conducted a thorough competition analysis and surveys - what are the advantages and disadvantages. I found a lot of interesting places and centers - both foreign and in the Czech Republic. 

### How successful where you in solving the problem?
- I think that thanks to this project, I will help the center get into the subconscious of customers. I will show what makes the center special.

## Inspiration
- üî¥ üü° + üîµ
- In terms of colors. Kutn√° Hora has a flag, which consists of red and yellow. These two colors are primary and I chose blue as the secondary color. And why? My great inspiration was a climbing wall for children. The climbing wall was created based on a work of art by artist Piet Mondrian. 
- However, my main and great inspiration is children. I want the overall visualization to be playful, funny, and engaging.

- I created a new logotype that will characterize the educational center. Next, I will create a new communication concept using offline and online advertising.
- As an example of my project, I will show you the existing logo of the education center and my new design. However, everything is in the process and I may change something.
