## My thesis project
---
During my studies at the school in the field of graphic design and media communication, I gained a lot of experience. For this reason, I decided to accept the challenge in the field of visual and marketing communication and create a new working concept of visual communication for the education center. The center is operated by the contributory organization Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region in Kutná Hora. The center was established to understand and bring contemporary art to the public as a natural way of life. As the organization's education center does not currently have a visual and communication style, I will also create a new communication strategy.







My main goal?
My goal is to create visual communication and strategic solution for the education center GASK in Kutná Hora and at the same time to raise attendance of the Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region. At the same time, I want to raise the profile of the education center, to build a positive public attitude towards this place so that the GASK organization becomes a new refuge and visiting the place.
