## My thesis project üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Education center GASK
---
During my studies at the school in the field of graphic design and media communication, I gained a lot of experience. For this reason, I decided to accept the challenge in the field of visual and marketing communication and create a new working concept of visual communication for the education center. 

- The center is operated by the contributory organization Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region in Kutn√° Hora. The center was established to understand and bring contemporary art to the public as a natural way of life. As the organization's education center does not currently have a visual and communication style, I will also create a new communication strategy.

### My main goal?
- My goal is to create visual communication and strategic solution for the education center GASK in Kutn√° Hora and at the same time to raise attendance of the Gallery of the Central Bohemian Region. At the same time, I want to raise the profile of the education center, to build a positive public attitude towards this place so that the GASK organization becomes a new refuge and visiting the place.

### Target group?
- The most relevant target group selection leads through verified or collected project data.
- This gallery offers the most programs, workshops, and events for children and families. So I decided to focus on the lower age category, thanks to their offer for children and youth.

### Inspiration?
- üî¥ + üü° + üîµ
- In terms of colors. My great inspiration was a climbing wall for children. The climbing wall was created based on a work of art by artist Piet Mondrian. I used these three basic colors - red, yellow, blue. However, Kutn√° Hora has a flag, which also consists of red and yellow.

- However, I have everything being developed so far, I am conducting analyzes and surveys. I will create a new logotype and slogan that will characterize the educational center. Next, I will create a new communication concept using offline and online advertising.
- As an example of my project, I will show you the existing logo of the training center and my new design.
