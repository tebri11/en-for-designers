#  My design story

Tereza Budská

Hi! I am a Junior Graphic Designer and I am specializing in creativity, web design, and visual identity.

My way started about 11 years old... 

Since my childhood I love everything about drawing. That was the point why I decided to absolve an art course called DRAW PLANET which was in Pragues art school... 
And there is my first picture!

This course prepared me for the exams in high school.






My high school was DUKE - of Design and Art, Book Culture, and Economics Náhorní. During our studies, we had the required experience for 10 days chosen by us. I decided on a small IT company called Abuco ICT. They offered me a part-time job as a graphic designer and I took it.

Now, I am here. I study at VŠKK and I am still working for Abuco ICT. I create web design, online banners, posts, visual identity, icons, illustrations, etc. for them.

In the future, I would like to create my own mark called te.b.ri studio. Of course, I want to improve my skills by watching new trends.

Except for art my other hobbies are dancing, listening to music and playing games. I was a cheerleader 5 years ago, for about 15 years, but the team fell apart. I tried aerobic, hip-hop, street dance… Now I am doing a shuffle dance (American dance) for fun.
