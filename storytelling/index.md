#  My design story

Hi! I am a Graphic Designer and I am specializing in creativity, web design, and visual identity.

The first question is why did I decide to be an artist?

My way started about 11 years old... 
At this age, I fell in love with art. I started drawing on notebooks, on desks, sometimes on the walls. I learned what spells two ordinary neutral colors can do - black and white. That was the point why I decided to absolve an art course called DRAW PLANET in Prague. So that was the reason why I decided to continue my studies at art school because. This course prepared me for the exams in high school.

And here is my first picture!

My journey continued at the DUKE high school - design and art, book culture and economics in Náhorní. Over the course of 4 years, I learned to work with watercolors, inks, pastels, etc.
It was a very creative school.

During our studies, we had to undertake the required internship for 10 days. I wrote an email to an IT company called Abuco ICT, which I stumbled upon on the Internet, and in the end, I was offered a job.
Now I work in this company as a creative graphic designer.

Most often I work with online advertising, I create banners, posts, gifs, icons, and sometimes with offline advertising such as flyers, business cards, flags, posters, etc.
For example, I have new icons that I created for the company.
