#  My design story üë©üèº‚Äçüé® 

Hi! I am a graphic designer and I am specializing in creativity and visual identity.

The first question is why did I decide to be an artist?

My way started about 11 years old... 
At this age, I fell in love with art. I started drawing on notebooks, on desks, sometimes on the walls. I learned what spells two ordinary neutral colors can do - black and white. That was the point why I decided to absolve an art course called Draw Planet in Prague. So that was the reason why I decided to continue my studies at art school because. This course prepared me for the exams in high school.

In my free time, I sketched and started painting on the wall like a real painter. 
And there is my first picture from Draw Planet and painting on the wall!

My journey continued at the DUKE high school - design and art, book culture and economics in N√°horn√≠. Over the course of 4 years, I learned to work with watercolors, inks, pastels, etc.
It was a very creative school.

During our studies, we had to undertake the required internship for 10 days. I wrote an email to an IT company called Abuco ICT, which I stumbled upon on the Internet, and in the end, I was offered a job.
Now I work in this company as a creative graphic designer.
Most often I work with online advertising, I create banners, posts, gifs, icons, and sometimes with offline advertising such as flyers, business cards, flags, posters, etc.
There are some of the icons I created for the company.

I am here right now. I study at university and work with 3 companies.
