- invitation to the wedding table

## What did the design look like?
1. I used thin font, cold colors with light pink. 
2. All sheets of paper were created on thick silver paper.
3. My sisterâ€™s favorite plant is eucalyptus - pure, cold, decent, minimalistâ€¦ So I used this green plant with small, pink flowers.
4. Each invitation contains a naturally small and large envelope in brown color.

## And result?
My sister was excited and I would like to try to create another wedding invitation for people.
