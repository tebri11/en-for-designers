The whole visual identity describes the wedding day of my sister and her husband. I used thin font, cold colors with light pink. All sheets of paper were created with strong, silver paper.

My sister's favorite plant is eucalypt - pure, cold, decent, minimalist... So I used this green plant with small, pink flowers. 

Each invitation includes a natural, brown small, and big envelope.
