# ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¿ Wedding design

12th June, 2021 was the wedding day of my sister.

- V + P
---
The whole visual identity describes the wedding day of my sister and her husband.
I created a schedule, a voucher for newlyweds like a gift, welcome poster (without welcome drink:)), wedding invitation, and invitation to the wedding table.

1. I used thin font, cold colors with light pink. 
2. All sheets of paper were created on thick silver paper.
3. My sisterâ€™s favorite plant is eucalypt - pure, cold, decent, minimalistâ€¦ So I used this green plant with small, pink flowers.
4. Each invitation contains a naturally small and large envelope in brown color.

My sister was excited and I would like to try to create another invitation for people.
