The whole visual identity describes the wedding day of my sister and her husband.
I created a program for the wedding day, a voucher for newlyweds like a gift, welcome poster (without welcome drink:)), wedding invitation, and invitation to the wedding table.

1. I used thin font, cold colors with light pink. 
2. All sheets of paper were created with strong, silver paper.
3. My sisterâ€™s favorite plant is eucalypt - pure, cold, decent, minimalistâ€¦ So I used this green plant with small, pink flowers.
4. Each invitation includes a natural, brown small, and big envelope.
