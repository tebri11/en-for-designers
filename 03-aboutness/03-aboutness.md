## My Story

![Alt text description.](me.jpg)

Since my childhood I love everything about drawing. That was the point why I decided to absolve an art course called DRAW PLANET which was in Pragues art school. This course prepared me for the exams on high school.

My high school was DUKE - of Design and Art, Book Culture, and Economics NÃ¡hornÃ­.
During studies we had required experience for 10 days choosen by us. I decided for small IT company called Abuco ICT. They offered me a part time job as a graphic designer and I took it. Nowadays I study at VÅ KK and I am still working for Abuco ICT. I create web design, online banners, posts, visual identity, icons, illustrations, etc. for them.

Except art my other hobbies are dancing, listening to music and playing games.

In a future I would like to create my own mark called teb.r.i studio. Of course I want to improve my skills by watching new trends.
