## About Me

A concise, single sentence about yourself as a designer (aim for about 100 characers).

## My Story

![Alt text description.](img/lsutnar-headshot.png) <! -- Maybe a photo of yourself? -->

A series of short paragraphs (one to three) about who you are, beyond being a designer; a personal bio that tells your story, with an emphasis on keywords about what you do, your passions, experience, etc. Consider each paragraph as two to three short, meaningful descriptions (120 characters each). Don’t worry about length — write first — then edit for clarity and conciseness later.
