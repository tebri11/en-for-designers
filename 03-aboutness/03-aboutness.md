## My Story
Since my childhood, I love everything about drawing. That was the point why I decided to absolve an art course called DRAW PLANET which was in Pragues art school. This course prepared me for the exams in high school.

My high school was DUKE - of Design and Art, Book Culture, and Economics NÃ¡hornÃ­.
During our studies, we had the required experience for 10 days chosen by us. I decided on a small IT company called Abuco ICT. They offered me a part-time job as a graphic designer and I took it. 

Now, I am here. I study at VÅ KK and I am still working for Abuco ICT. I create web design, online banners, posts, visual identity, icons, illustrations, etc. for them.

In the future, I would like to create my own mark called te.b.ri studio. Of course, I want to improve my skills by watching new trends.

Except for art my other hobbies are dancing, listening to music and playing games. I was a cheerleader 5 years ago, for about 15 years, but the team fell apart. I tried aerobic, hip-hop, street dance... Now I am doing a shuffle dance (American dance) for fun.

ðŸŒ¸ So thatâ€™s my story.
