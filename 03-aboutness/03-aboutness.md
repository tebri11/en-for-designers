## My Story

![Alt text description.](me.jpg)

When I was a child I try to art school in Prague named DRAW PLANET. Besides my next hobbies included dancing - cheerleaders, street dance, hip hop, aerobic, etc.

I went to this art course for about 2 years and after primary school, I went to secondary school DUKE - of Design and Art, Book Culture, and Economics Náhorní. For about 10 days I participated in practice in a small IT company named Abuco ICT and they gave me a job like graphic.

However now I am a student in VŠKK, I am working externally with a few companies. In the future a would like to find my dream job.
