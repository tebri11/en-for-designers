## ðŸŒ¸ Voice & Tone

#### When we are speaking in normal conversation, we are always adjusting our pitch and tone without even thinking about it. But during my presentation there will be times when I really want to emphasize a certain point. These important points need to be clarified so the audience understands that they are important - we can stress importance by changing the tone and inflection of voice.  

- loud and clear voice with a nice low tone - confident and credible
- very high pitch and speaking softly - nervous

### Voice
A strong voice conveys confidence. I must speak loudly and clearly enough that listeners hear and understand what I am saying. Projecting voice also helps my personality show. 

### Tone
The tone of my voice also can convey different feelings to listeners and this is a great way to captivate them and engage them in your message.
